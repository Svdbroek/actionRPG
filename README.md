## Reflection 

had a lot of fun.

two lines of code broke the testing (line 48 and line 65). One I did for gameplay reasons, but the other (l65) one I can't really explaine why. All my debugging shows that the weapon still gets added to the inventory array.

I ran into a couple of things I don't completely understand and marked them as such in my comments. 
I feel like if I had to start from scratch again I could probably clean the code up a bit,
but I'm not sure if have the energy for that at this point.
